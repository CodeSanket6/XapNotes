## Usage

Using the XapNotes Notes App is straightforward. It runs directly in your web browser.

### Running the Application

1.  **Open `index.html`:** Locate the `index.html` file within the `awesome-note-app` folder. **Double-click this file** to open the application automatically in your default web browser.

    * **Alternative (Recommended for development):** If you have a local development server (like VS Code's "Live Server" extension, or a simple Python/Node.js HTTP server), **start your server** from the root of the `awesome-note-app` directory. Then, open your web browser and navigate to the address provided by your server (e.g., `http://localhost:5500` or `http://127.0.0.1:8000`). This method is better for development as it handles pathing correctly.

### Interacting with the App

Once the app is loaded in your browser, you will see the main interface:

* **Creating a New Note:**
    1.  Find the input field, likely labeled **"Note Title"**, and type in a concise title for your note.
    2.  Locate the larger text area, typically labeled **"Note Content"** or **"What's on your mind?"**, and type in the main body of your note.
    3.  Click the **"Add Note"** or **"Save Note"** button. Your newly created note will then appear in the list of notes.

* **Viewing Existing Notes:**
    * All your saved notes are displayed in a list on the main screen. You'll see their titles, and possibly a short preview of their content.
    * **Click on a note's title or body** in the list to expand it and view its full content.

* **Editing a Note:**
    1.  Click on the note you wish to edit in the list. This will usually bring up an "Edit" interface or make the existing content editable.
    2.  Modify the title or content as needed.
    3.  Click the **"Save Changes"** or **"Update Note"** button to apply your modifications.

* **Deleting a Note:**
    * Each note in the list will have a **"Delete"** button or an "X" icon next to it.
    * Click this button/icon next to the note you want to remove. A confirmation prompt might appear to prevent accidental deletions.
